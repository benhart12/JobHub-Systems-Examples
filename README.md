# JobHub Systems Examples

This repository contains curated, non-proprietary system design and implementation examples extracted from a larger production SaaS platform.

The purpose of this repo is to showcase how specific subsystems are designed, structured, and implemented in isolation, without exposing core application code or sensitive business logic.

## Repository Structure

### JobHubOutreach
Contains examples related to internal outreach and automation workflows.  
This includes data flow, scripting, and orchestration patterns used to support lead research and outreach processes.

Focus areas:
- Automation logic
- Data processing pipelines
- System integration patterns

### JobHubProperty
Contains examples related to data modeling and system design for real estate–focused workflows.  
This subsystem explores how complex domain relationships are represented and managed within a larger platform.

Focus areas:
- Data models and relationships
- Domain-driven design considerations
- Maintainable and extensible system structure

## Scope and Intent

- This repository **does not** contain the full JobHub application.
- Code is intentionally scoped, simplified, and anonymized.
- Some components are illustrative rather than production-complete.
- The emphasis is on architecture, data flow, and design decisions.

This repo is intended for technical review and discussion, not as a standalone product.
